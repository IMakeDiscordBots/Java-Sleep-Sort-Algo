# Java-Sleep-Sort-Algo

## NOTICE!!

I am begging you, please don't use this as an actual sorting algorithm. You are much better of using something like quick sort, as this is very slow when the numbers are very spread out(e.g going from 10 -> 44). This is not a good sorting algorithm, and you can find/make a much more efficient one that does not involve putting Threads to sleep.


## How to use and example of usage

```bash
# cd into project directory
$ cd Java-Sleep-Sort

# Compile
$ javac Thing.java

# Run
$ java Thing #followed by numbers you'd like sorted, seperated by spaces

# e.g
$ cd Java-Sleep-Sort
$ javac Thing.java
$ java Thing 10 4 3 2 7 9 6 9 8 23 44
```
